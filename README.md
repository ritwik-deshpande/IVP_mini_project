# Tabular Data Extraction from Document Images



The project will help you develop a method which can be used to address a general problem of
digitizing/extracting tabular data from images of documents/papers containing tabular data with
several applications. Paper forms are widely-used for data collection in various surveys, records (ex.
patient centric medical records). But accessing and analysing data collected on paper is difficult.
Manual data entry is time-consuming and error-prone. A large amount of documents produced in an
enterprise also contain tabular data. Such tables convey relationship between multi-dimensional
data elements and attributes in a compact (high information density) and easily readable format. For
example, in an invoice document, the line items are placed in a tabular from which conveys the
number of items purchased, amount etc.

The objective of this project is to develop a program/software using image processing and computer
vision techniques to extract accurate data from tables present in these images. You need to exploit
the structural properties and other information/constrains relating to the text region within the
document. You may make certain assumptions about the input images (regarding illumination
condition, orientation, noise, clutter etc.) to begin solving the problem but then try to relax them to
get a more general solution that is applicable for wider scenarios.
